<h2>What is ChatbotSteve?</h2>
<p>ChatbotSteve is a way to communicate with Steve while he is the Minecraft biomes. The main idea of the project is to implement user text/speech recognition to control Steve's actions. User's can control the agent's action depending on the user’s command. The current list of actions ranges from basic commands (walk, jump, crouch, turn) to more complicated ones (find animals/objects, feed/kill them, etc.). In a real time example, typing ‘find the pig’ will command the agent, Steve, to find the closest pig in the spawned world. Users can further command Steve to ‘feed the pig’ or ‘kill the pig’. These commands will be implemented to work for all animals/creatures. Furthermore, Steve is able to understand compound sentences, allowing him to perform more than one action at a time.
